== Adventurer's Guide ==

Unlike most text adventure engines, there are very few global commands.
No matter where you are, you can issue the command:

show inventory

... or its alias:

show items

... to display what you are carrying. Similarly, to inspect the state
of carried items, issue the command:

show state

... or its alias:

show form

... and the game will display the state of items that have one.

The engine supports compound issuance of commands (doing more than
one thing at once) by separating commands with "and" or "then".
You can even use ", and " or ", then " as separators for this purpose.

If you get any quests, you can check their status with the commands:

show quests

... and:

show quest details

All other commands are specific to each room of the adventure.
Good luck and have fun!
